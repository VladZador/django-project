                    Hello! And welcome to the Los Pollos Hermanos family. My name is Gustavo, but you can
                    call me "Gus". I am thrilled that you'll be joining our team. Each and every day, we serve our
                    customers exceptional food, with impecable service. We take pride in everything that we do. And
                    after this 10 week online seminar, I'm sure you'll fit right in. I like to think I see things in
                    people. To begin, I'd like to talk about the cornerstone of the Los Pollos Hermanos brand.
                    Communication. As an employee of Los Pollos Hermanos, you set the tone for the entire dining
                    experience. Be mindful of what your words, and behavior communicate to our guests. Always be aware
                    of your posture, remember to stand up straight. Your customers and your back will thank you for it.
                    Put effort into your appearance, all employees are required to dress appropriately. Keep your
                    uniform clean, and pressed. If you want respect, you must look respectable. Speak in complete
                    sentences, we never use one word greetings like "Hey" or "Yeah?" Always make eye contact, and
                    finally, whenever you're with a customer or not, remain composed. Inside, you can be thinking about
                    your homework, or friends, or your side business, but no one should ever know it. Because at Los
                    Pollos Hermanos, someone... Is always watching. So don't forget to smile! That's all for today, see
                    you next time when we'll be discussing cleanliness.
